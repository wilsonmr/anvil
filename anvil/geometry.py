        length N, the number of shifts. For the given system length used to
        instance Geometry2D, which refers to size of a 2D state (length * length)
        returns a tensor, size (N, length^2). Row i of the returned tensor indexes a
        split state \phi = (\phiA, \phiB) which has been shifted by shift[i] in
        dimension dims[i]. The shifts are performed on the 2D cartesian states.

        element i of shifts and dims can either both be an integer or both be a
        tuple of equal length. In the case that the element is a tuple, it
        represents multiple simultaneous shifts in multiple dimensions.

        By default shifts = (1, 1) and dims = (0, 1) and the resulting tensor indexes
        the nearest neighbours above and to the left respectively. This convention
        is according to to torch.roll

        Parameters
        ----------
        shifts: tuple
            a tuple of shifts to be applied. Each element represents a shift and can
            either be an integer (if the shift is in a single dimension) or a tuple
            if the shift is applied simultaneously in multiple dimensions (see
            Examples).

        dims: tuple
            a tuple of dimensions to apply `shifts` to. As with shift, each element
            in dim can itself be a tuple which indicates that multiple shifts will
            be applied in multiple dimensions simultaneously. Note that
            corresponding entries of dims and shifts must also match (either both
            ints or both tuples of same length).

        Returns
        -------
        shift: torch.Tensor
            Tensor which can be used to index split states such that

                state = tensor([\phiA, \phiB]),

            then state[shift] will return a 2xlength tensor:

                state[shift] -> tensor([[neighbour right], [neighbour down]])

        Example
        -------
        Consider the small example of 2x2 state:

        >>> state_2d = torch.arange(4).view(2, 2)
        >>> state_2d
        tensor([[0, 1],
                [2, 3]])

        If we use a checkerboard pattern to split state into \phiA and \phiB
        then \phiA = [0, 3] and \phiB = [1, 2]

        >>> phi = torch.tensor([0, 3, 1, 2])
        >>> geom = Geometry2D(2)
        >>> shift = geom.get_shift()
        >>> phi[shift]
        tensor([[2, 1, 3, 0],
                [1, 2, 0, 3]])

        to see how multiple shifts works, consider the shift (1, 1) in dimensions
        (0, 1): up one, left one

        >>> shift = geom.get_shift(shifts=((1, 1),), dims=((0, 1),))
        >>> phi[shift]
        tensor([[3, 0, 2, 1]])

        Notes
        -----
        The conventions for how the shifts are applied are according the torch.roll
        function, shift = +ve rolls the state in a direction that corresponds
        to ascending index when using standard python indexing.
