layers.py

Contains nn.Modules which implement transformations of an input vector whilst computing the
Jacobian determinant of the inverse transformation.

Each transformation layers may contain several neural networks or learnable parameters.

A normalising flow, f, can be constructed from multiple layers using function composition:

        f(\phi) = g_1( g_2( ... ( g_n( \phi ) ) ... ) )

which is implemented using the architecture provided by torch.nn

Layers can be divided into two classes.

1. Coupling layers: (x_in, x_passive, log_density) -> (phi_out, log_density)

    Takes two tensors `x_in`, `x_passive` of dimensions (n_batch, D) and one tensor `log_density`
    of dimensions (n_batch, 1).

    The `x_in` is transformed by a bijective function whose parameters are neural networks
    which themselves take `x_passive` as an input vector.

    The current value of the logarithm of the probability density is updated by adding the
    Jacobian determinant of the *inverse* of the coupling transformation.

2. Full layers: (x_in, log_density) -> (phi_out, log_density)

    Takes a single input tensor and transforms the entire tensor, with no coupling occuring
    between lattice sites.

    These layers may be 'cascaded' using anvil.core.Sequential provided `x_in` is the full
    dataset.

    In addition to the w_k and h_k, the derivatives d_k at the knot points are generated
    by a neural network. d_0 is set equal to d_K.

    Defing the slopes s_k = h_k / w_k and fractional position within a bin
        
            alpha(x) = (x - x_{k-1}) / w_k

    the coupling transformation is defined piecewise by

            \phi = C^{-1}(x, {h_k, s_k, d_k})
                 = \phi_{k-1}
                 + ( h_k(s_k * \alpha^2 + d_k * \alpha * (1 - \alpha)) )
                 / ( s_k + (d_{k+1} + d_k - 2s_k) * \alpha * (1 - \alpha) )

    Parameters
    ----------
    size_in: int
        Size of the passive partition at dimension 1, which is also the size of the input
        vector for the neural networks.
    size_out: int
        Size of the active partition, being transformed by the spline layer, at dimension 1,
        which is also the number of rows in the matrix output by the neural networks.
    n_segments: int
        Number of segments (bins).
    hidden_shape: list
        list containing hidden vector sizes the neural network.
    activation: str
        string which is a key for an activation function for all but the final layers
        of the network.
    batch_normalise: bool
        flag indicating whether or not to use batch normalising within the neural
        network.

    Attributes
    ----------
    network: torch.nn.Module
        the dense layers of the network, values are intialised as per the default
        initialisation of `nn.Linear`
    phase_shift: torch.nn.Parameter
        a learnable phase shift which incurs no Jacobian penalty, the purpose being 
        that 0 and 2\pi are no longer fixed points of the transformation.

    Methods
    -------
    forward(x_in, x_passive, log_density)
        Performs an affine transformation of the `x_in` tensor, using the `x_passive`
        tensor as parameters for the neural networks. Returns the transformed tensor
        along with the updated log density.
